# Step 1: Importing Scikit-learn
import sklearn

# Step 2: Importing Scikit-learn’s Dataset
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer

# Load dataset
data = load_breast_cancer()

# Organize our data
label_names = data['target_names']
labels = data['target']
feature_names = data['feature_names']
features = data['data']

# Step 3: Organizing Data into Sets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split our data into training and testing sets
train, test, train_labels, test_labels = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)

# Step 4: Building and Evaluating the Model
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB

# Initialize our classifier
gnb = GaussianNB()

# Train our classifier
model = gnb.fit(train, train_labels)

# Make predictions
preds = gnb.predict(test)

# Step 5: Evaluating the Model’s Accuracy
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Evaluate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(test_labels, preds)
print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy:.2%}")
